        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political Science Major ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I was born in Upland, CA and have lived in Fontana, CA my entire life. I attended and graduated from nearby Bloomington High School where I was a member of the Associated Student Body (ASB) team and played baseball for four years. Iâ€™d like to think I fared well as the teamâ€™s best first baseman, but my batting average was lower than the stock market in 2008. I began studying at the University of California shortly after graduating from high school in 2016 and I chose to major in political science after being heavily influenced by teachers in high school that had immense passion for United States history and the political system of our country. Their passion rubbed off on me and I have enjoyed delving into both topics ever since. My coursework in college has been expansive, ranging from anthropology, history, and ethnic studies to biology, geology, and computer science. I spent some time studying at Chaffey College, but I have since returned to UCR and will be graduating in June 2022. <br><br>

          I have been employed at Apex Imaging Services in Pomona, CA since I graduated from High School in 2016. I have three years of experience in a project coordinator role and three years in an accounting role. As a project coordinator, I worked alongside project managers to ensure our remodel and construction projects were completed meeting the highest standards for our clients. In this position, I worked heavily on Microsoft Excel, Powerpoint and Word, became very familiar with Microsoft Outlook, strengthened my communication skills through daily phone calls and daily reports to our partners, and grew enough to establish myself as an integral part of the team. I then transitioned into an accounting associate role in which I was placed in the accounts receivable department. In this position, I worked closer than ever with our clients to ensure that our company was paid in a timely manner and that our records were always maintained. Somewhere along the way, I received a notary public certification so that I could help my teammates process payment applications that required notarized signatures from our company leadership.<br><br>

          My career ambitions have led me down the path of studying for the LSAT in preparation to apply to law school this fall. I have had great interest in the field of law for as long as I can remember. Although I had no business doing so, but I loved watching dramatized court television as a kid and I havenâ€™t looked back since. It is my desire to practice in the field of criminal defense sometime down the road, but I understand that isnâ€™t an area that a first-year attorney simply walks into. I look forward to the opportunity and the challenge of attending law school and eventually serving those in need of proper representation in the court of law. Iâ€™m particularly interested in the idea of helping exonerate those who have been wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not, and in many cases could not have committed. Obtaining a JD is a privileged opportunity that I intend to tackle head-on.

            <p>
              My role is to coordinate and manage an array of remodel construction projects, some of which belong to our highest profile client accounts. The due diligence required to complete these projects falls on my shoulders, regularly tasking with reporting the progress to our clientsâ€™ upper management teams through daily email reports and weekly conference calls. Recent project manager responsibilities have required me to see out project completion from a more in-depth profit margin, job costing, and overall quality control perspective with priority being customer satisfaction. Being in the field with clients has helped grow my customer service and professional communication abilities.<br>

            <p>
              This position offered opportunities to learn computer basics (Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, Photoshop) while being given PowerPoint, cold call, material ordering and other daily tasks. I worked closely with our manager of business development to help with sales, bidding, transmittals, and RFPs. Sales was an emphasis of my daily tasks until I eventually began working alongside the director of human resources and was eventually promoted.

            <p>
              My first workplace experience came while I was still in high school. Milestone MX was a motocross park in Riverside, CA where I would help the safety team performing the tasks of a flagger. Whenever a rider fell on the track or was having difficulty operating their bikes, I would step in and ensure the safety of that rider and the riders around them.
